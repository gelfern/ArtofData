### Introduction
I simply cannot resist a brief history lesson -- the story of Roe v. Wade fascinates me:  
Jane Roe, born “Norma McCorvey" in 1947, lived in Texas under the custody of a single alcoholic mother. McCorvey was already married and pregnant by the time she reached my age; I still have trouble flipping eggs on a frying pan without breaking them in half. Facing a cold, harsh reality of harboring a life within her, only halfway through her teenage years after being raised in an insecure household, McCorvey had no choice but to carry a pregnancy to term before giving her own child away to her mother. 

Pregnant again in 1969, McCorvey wanted an abortion, which was inaccessible to her **unless** her life became threatened by the pregnancy. Subsequently, McCorvey was referred to feminist lawyers, Linda Coffee and Sarah Weddington, who were searching for a client to challenge abortion laws. By the time Coffee and Weddington changed Roe's case (McCorvey anonymized her name to Jane Roe) to a class-action lawsuit and a federal judge panel ruled that Texas’s abortion laws were unconstitutional, Mccorvey had given birth and gave this child up for adoption. However, when the state of Texas appealed, the Supreme Court ruled that women had the right to an abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy, “free of interference by the state,” in 1973. Thus, _Roe v. Wade_ was born. 

It is at this point in history that the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justin2028/perspectives-on-abortion-1975-2022) I am extrapolating from becomes relevant, which "describes the **changing perspectives** on a woman's right to **choose** in America." 
As explained by [Justin Oh](https://www.kaggle.com/justin2028), who put together this dataset and posted it on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), all official figures are from Gallup, a global analytics firm which is formerly known as the American Institute of Public Opinion. [Gallup](https://www.gallup.com/home.aspx) is uniquely equipped to properly illustrate how the American opinion on abortions has shifted between just after _Roe v. Wade_ and the _Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization_ (the Supreme Court case ruled in June 2022, which effectively overturned the precedent set by _Roe v. Wade_).
