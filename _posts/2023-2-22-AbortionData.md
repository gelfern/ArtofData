“Choice” is dignity. Moreover, “choice” is freedom. 

# Introduction
I can't resist a brief history lesson; the story of Roe v. Wade fascinates me.* 
Jane Roe, born “Norma McCorvey” and later anonymized her name, lived in Texas under the custody of a single alcoholic mother. By the time McCorvey was the very same age as me, she was married and pregnant: at 16 years of age, McCorvey was married, impregnated, and divorced before the birth of her first child, whom she relinquished into the custody of her turbulent mother. I still have trouble flipping eggs on a frying pan without breaking them in half; however, facing a cold, harsh reality of harboring a life within her, only halfway through her teenage years after being raised in an insecure household, McCorvey had no choice but to carry a pregnancy to term before giving her own child away. 

Pregnant again in 1969, McCorvey wanted an abortion, which was inaccessible to her unless her life became threatened by the pregnancy. Subsequently, McCorvey was referred to feminist lawyers, Linda Coffee and Sarah Weddington, who were searching for a client to challenge abortion laws. By the time Coffee and Weddington changed the case to a class-action lawsuit and a federal judge panel ruled that Texas’s abortion laws were unconstitutional, Mccorvey gave birth and gave the child up for adoption; however, when the state of Texas appealed, the Supreme Court ruled that women had the right to an abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy, “free of interference by the state,” in 1973. 

At this point in history, the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/justin2028/perspectives-on-abortion-1975-2022) I am extrapolating from becomes relevant.
