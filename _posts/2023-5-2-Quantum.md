# What if Ant Man tried to enter the "Quantum Realm" by means of a quantum computer? Could we predict how long it would take him to go quantum?
## *- Naomi Gelfer, 1 week younger than present day*

This is a fascinating question, Naomi! Thanks for asking! I can already feel myself getting carried away...
Let's begin with a few key clarifications: I'm assuming you're asking, "what if Ant Man was processed by a quantum computer in order to enter the quantum realm?" -- I'm taking a lot of creative liberties here considering Ant Man entering the quantum realm is a fantasy in itself, so in the MCU, why wouldn't he be able to enter the Quantum Realm by means of being processed by a quantum computer??? Stay with me here, this assumption is the least wild were going to get together :)
Onto my next point of clarification,
