# CRISPR-Cas9 Gene Editing for Sickle Cell Disease and β-Thalassemia

In this post, I analyze a scientific report published in 2020 regarding the usage of CRISPR gene-editing techniques to bolster the production of fetal hemoglobin in patients with Sickle Cell Disease and Transfusion-dependent β-Thalassemia. The overarching goal of this assignment is for to develop an understanding of how to critically examine scientific studies and analyze datasets.

Let's dive in... 

### 1. What are the null and alternative hypotheses?

Null hypothesis: Infusing CRISPR-Cas9 edited CD34+ cells at the erythroid-specific enhancer region (BCL11A) for the reduction of BCL11A expression into patients with TDT and SCD does not reactivate fetal hemoglobin production, therefore doing nothing to combat the severe diseases. 

Alternative hypothesis: Infusing CRISPR-Cas9 edited CD34+ cells at the erythroid-specific enhancer region (BCL11A) for the reduction of BCL11A expression into patients with TDT and SCD reactivates fetal hemoglobin production to combat the severe diseases. 


### 2. Who is collecting and analyzing this data?



### 3. What datasets does this study reference or use? Are these datasets available to the public?



### 4. Why are they interested in this data?




### 5. What data is being recorded? What data might be left out?



### 6. What evidence did they present to back up their conclusions?



### 7. How was this study funded?



### 8. Do you think publish or perish had an effect on this study?



### Thank you for your consideration of how the general public can best mitigate and understand how data is being used in the scientific world and what studies are being carried out in the name of science.
