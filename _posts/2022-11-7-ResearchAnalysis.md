# CRISPR-Cas9 Gene Editing for Sickle Cell Disease and β-Thalassemia

In this post, I analyze a scientific report published in 2020 regarding the usage of CRISPR gene-editing techniques to bolster the production of fetal hemoglobin in patients with Sickle Cell Disease and Transfusion-dependent β-Thalassemia. The overarching goal of this assignment is for to develop an understanding of how to critically examine scientific studies and analyze datasets.

Let's dive in... 

CTX00: Autologous CRISPR-Cas9-edited CD34+ cells that were genetically edited to reactivate the production of fetal hemoglobin
TDT: Transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia
SCD: Sickle cell disease

### 1. What are the null and alternative hypotheses?

**Null hypothesis:** Infusing CRISPR-Cas9 edited CD34+ cells at the erythroid-specific enhancer region (BCL11A) for the reduction of BCL11A expression into patients with TDT and SCD does not reactivate fetal hemoglobin production, therefore doing nothing to combat the severe diseases. 

**Alternative hypothesis:** Infusing CRISPR-Cas9 edited CD34+ cells at the erythroid-specific enhancer region (BCL11A) for the reduction of BCL11A expression into patients with TDT and SCD reactivates fetal hemoglobin production to combat the severe diseases. 


### 2. Who is collecting and analyzing this data?

This paper was written by 26 authors and it is implied that they collectively produced and analyzed the data. Specifically, while they are listed at the top of the study, directly below its title, it cannot be confirmed which of the authors actually collected the data and which analyzed it; throughout the methodology and discussion of the study, the authors describe themselves as “we” and discuss their data by saying “our,” meaning that the paper does not provide information on who was actually conducting the scientific procedures and who was analyzing implications of the data. I find this as problematic, because even though the authors' general credentials are listed, it is unclear which supposedly qualified researcher was collecting/analyzing the data.  

### 3. What datasets does this study reference or use? Are these datasets available to the public?

This study does not reference any existing datasets, however, they use and discuss the data collected in the study. These datasets that the researchers collected are not publicly available beyond the information in the figures/media published in the original article because of privacy concerns regarding public usage of the data, as well as patient privacy laws. As included in the linked data sharing statement, if qualified researchers receive approved access to the data by an internal committee from CRISPR and Vertex (the organizations that funded this study), this data would still be de-identified and anonymized. Further, the mechanism of data sharing would only be through a secured portal after the signing of a Data Sharing Agreement, which requires qualified researchers to obtain ethics boards/conditional regulatory approval for their proposed conduct of their proposed further research. Finally, data availability and supporting documents only become available two years after study completion. 

### 4. Why are they interested in this data?

The authors are interested in this data because they want to empirically prove their alternative hypothesis that gene-editing techniques can be used to promote hemoglobin production and combat TDT and SCD. They present a comprehensive analysis of their data in order to demonstrate that their protocol was followed as written and that their hypotheses were addressed quantitatively and without bias. As mentioned in the introduction to the study, SDS and TDT are the most common monogenic diseases worldwide, meaning that further data collection and studies on the diseases is crucial to finding treatments for the diseases. At the same time, as gene-editing is a new and developing technology, careful, precise, and thorough data collection is absolutely necessary in the field of study. 

### 5. What data is being recorded? What data might be left out?

Generally, data regarding the protocol and results is being recorded, in addition to data on the patients throughout their treatments and their histories of other treatments for SCD and TDT. Conversely, the authors leave out personal information about the patients because of privacy concerns. For both trials (SCD and TDT), the patients were female; patient 1 (TDT) was 19 years old and patient 2 (SCD) was 33 years old. This means that the treatment was not tested on subjects of other genders and a larger age range. Comprehensive analyses of clinical samples were not performed, nor did the authors characterize clonal diversity; effectively, while CTX001 administration promotes fetal hemoglobin production, the paper does not analyze/study the use of CTX001 therapy in patients beyond the two described in the trial and the eight patients in the follow-up research. Specifically, after the study was published, eight more subjects were infused with CTX001; problematically, two of the eight had TDT and only two had SCD, meaning these additional studies mostly targeted those with TDT. In the discussion, the paper concedes that the study is not enough to generalize that these results can be used as treatment for TDT and SCD.

### 6. What evidence did they present to back up their conclusions?

In the published article, the authors provide a summary of their methodology, their results, and a discussion of the implications of their conclusions. The evidence is presented in the results section as a description of how the infusion of the CTX001 drug product affected two specific patients with TDT and SCD, respectively. The results section also includes a table that displays frequency of allelic editing in CTX001 cells and several bar graphs and diagrams that show hemoglobin levels in the patients over time. The authors also include a full, comprehensive protocol of the experiments on both patients found as supplementary material. This protocol describes exactly what procedures were carried out and how results were collected and analyzed to address the hypotheses. Overall, the authors conclude that the presented data supports the alternative hypothesis. However, they do concede that further experimental testing is required to generalize these preliminary results with respect to other patients.

### 7. How was this study funded?

This study was funded by CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex Pharmaceuticals, who also approved the full protocol and have control over the sharing of the data in the experiment. The two patients in this study were enrolled in CLIMB SCD-121 (http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT03745287) and CLIMB THAL-111 (http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT03655678) as they had Sickle Cell Disease and β-thalassemia, respectively. 


### 8. Do you think publish or perish had an effect on this study?

In my opinion, publish or perish did have an effect on this study. My main reason for this is that the research was only administered on two patients and the follow-up research only occurred after the paper was published and still does not fully support a generalizable treatment for those with SCD and TDT because the eight patients were only studied for three months; three months, in my view, is not a scientifically significant amount of time, meaning that I feel that the researchers rushed to publish the paper, especially since they published the paper before doing the follow-up study. Conversely, fetal hemoglobin production was empirically promoted, meaning that the authors proved that gene-editing techniques can be used against the severe diseases, and so this can be characterized as monumental preliminary research that promotes further studies. 


### Thank you for your consideration of how the general public can best mitigate and understand how data is being used in the scientific world and what studies are being carried out in the name of science.
