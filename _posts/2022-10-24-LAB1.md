# Dive into the Digimon Universe 

**Lab 1** presented me with a series of tasks; out I emerge victorious and near-fluent in the intricacies of the Digimon and how to sift through data on them.

This posts guides all readers through my thought processes and questions, a manifestation of my perseverance, as I worked to complete Lab 1. 

Let's begin with question 1...

## What is the Average Speed of all Digimon? 

Here I will put images and answers 




Moving swiftly to question 2 ... here's where things get super interesting :) 


## Write a function that can count the number of Digimon with a specific attribute.

Here I will put images and answers 




Finally, onto question 3 - I had a slew of thoughts and ideas on this one! 


## If your team only has 15 Memory, name a team of up to 3 Digimon that has at least 300 attack (Atk) in total.

Here I will put images and answers 



# Reflection 
First of all, I collaborated with my peer, Nate Garelik, to discuss ideas and approaches to this lab. In addition, he and I worked together to gain a understanding of beautiful jekyll and how to configure our websites. 

Add more reflection here 



## Thank you so much for reading! See you again soon :)
