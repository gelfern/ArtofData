# CRISPR-Cas9 Gene Editing for Sickle Cell Disease and β-Thalassemia

In this post, I analyze a scientific report published in 2020 regarding the usage of CRISPR gene-editing techniques to bolster the production of fetal hemoglobin in patients with Sickle Cell Disease and Transfusion-dependent β-Thalassemia. The overarching goal of this assignment is for to develop an understanding of how to critically examine scientific studies and analyze datasets.
