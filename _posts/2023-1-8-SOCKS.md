# Into the Animal Crossing-Verse 
### (yes, animal crossing-verse -- a more clunky version of into the digi-verse, but I like continuity) 

This post provides a glimpse into my process of working through solutions to lab 2. I've curated this blog post to optimize my (extensive) audience's understanding of my thinking - read my comments (in my code screenshots) for in-depth explanations of why I wrote each line of code. Let's start with a look into how I accessed **Socks API** provided for this lab and obtained the dataset to analyze... 

## Part 1: Generating a CSV of Socks

First, I imported requests and csv and set up some useful variables: 
![initilizeVars](../assets/img/initializing.jpg)

Then, it was time to open up the CSV I created where I was going to write in data on each sock. My first move was to write the first row of my CSV with the headers for each column, so that my data could be best organized. I retrieved the headers from the keys in each key/value pair stored in the data for the sock at index 0. 
![openrequests](../assets/img/openedFile.jpg)

Once I had headers in my CSV file, I created a while loop that would allow me to write the corresponding data for every sock accessed through the API

## Part 2: Analyzing Sock Variation

![checkingforGreatest](../assets/img/greatestVariation.jpg)

![listofsockswithgreatest](../assets/img/greatestList.jpg)

![printVariation](../assets/img/printVariation.jpg)

![output](../assets/img/variationOutput.jpg)

I am not, however, satisfied with my VS Code terminal output (aesthetically), so here is my final answer to the question
on sock variation, but neater: 

The socks that have the greatest variation are:
- argyle crew socks 
- color-blocked socks
- frilly knee-high socks
- holey tights
- kiddie socks
- mixed-tweed socks
- no-show socks
- semi-opaque socks
- semi-opaque tights
- sequin leggings
- simple-accent socks
- striped socks
- striped tights
- tube socks
- ultra no-show socks
- vivid leggings
- vivid socks
- vivid tights

All 18 of these socks have a variation of 8 (as stored in the "greatest_variation" variable) . 


## Part 3: Socks! Colorful Socks!

![checkforcolor2](../assets/img/Color2loop.jpg)

![printingcolors](../assets/img/printSockcolors.jpg)

![coloruglyoutput](../assets/img/colorOutput.jpg)

Again, I find myself unsatisfied (aesthetically) with the VS Code terminal output. Here is a nicer (in my humble opinion) version of my answer to this lab question...

Every color a sock can be and how many socks of that color there are (parameters for followed as instructed in lab description): 
- Pink: 44
- Red: 43
- Aqua: 33
- Orange: 28
- Purple: 39
- Green: 51
- Blue: 48
- Yellow: 34
- White: 89
- Black: 65
- Beige: 16
- Gray: 33 
- Brown: 11
- Colorful: 14
