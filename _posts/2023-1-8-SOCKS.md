# Into the Animal Crossing-Verse 
### (yes, animal crossing-verse -- a more clunky version of into the digi-verse, but I like continuity) 

This post provides a glimpse into my process of working through solutions to lab 2. Let's start with a look into how I accessed and obtained data from the **Socks API** provided for this lab... 

## Part 1: Generating a CSV of Socks


## Part 2: Analyzing Sock Variation

I am not, however, satisfied with my VS Code terminal output (aesthetically), so here is my final answer to the question
on sock variation, but neater: 

The socks that have the greatest variation are:
- argyle crew socks 
- color-blocked socks
- frilly knee-high socks
- holey tights
- kiddie socks
- mixed-tweed socks
- no-show socks
- semi-opaque socks
- semi-opaque tights
- sequin leggings
- simple-accent socks
- striped socks
- striped tights
- tube socks
- ultra no-show socks
- vivid leggings
- vivid socks
- vivid tights

All 18 of these socks have a variation of 8 (as stored in the "greatest_variation" variable) .
