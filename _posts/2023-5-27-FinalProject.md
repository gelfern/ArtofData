# An Argument on the Demographics of the Arguing
Picture this: you're eleven and one of the only two girls in your first middle school debate team meeting -- fighting to float  within a turbulent sea of boys (only recently having blossomed from prepubescence). That was me about 5 years ago. So, my best friend/debate partner and I did the only thing that could be done: build a fort of desks in the center of the room, while the rest of the boys took their seats behind desks against the walls of the room, encircling and encroaching upon our makeshift citadel. I've been fighting from within that fort to this day. 

As I make the ironic choice to open a data analysis project with purely anecdotal comments, I standby my following assertions. The high school competetive debate sphere in the United States (or, from my personal experience, in the Northeast) is riddled with **misogyny**, **bias**, and **inequity**. And, while I've had the privelage of emerging from the gates of Harvard campus, sleep-deprived but fueled by vendettas against all of the judges that "voted wrong," like I had just escaped a fever dream, the niche little bubble that I used to believe contained the debate sphere has popped a long time ago.  

A quick off-time road-map (teehee -- hopefully at least one of my readers is a debater...): in **section 1**, this project dives into visualizing critical empirics describing gender differences in competive high school debate. Then, we're skipping college and marching straight to state legislatures, the US Sentate, and the House of Representatives in **section 2**; specifically, section 2 will consist of data visualizations of the gender demographics of various election years in the past decade. Finally, to connect the first 2/3s of this post, **section 3** seeks to correlate what conclusions can be extrapolated from section 1 with the *very real* effects that the unequal and male-dominated political spheres we discovered in **section 2** have on our world.  

As you read this post, please keep in mind that feminism and every invidual's intersectionality can never be mutually exclusive: the American reality puts white women at an advantage when compared to women of color. My experiences as a debater have been directly informed by my identity as a young, white cisgender woman. As we draw conclusions from the data I present in this post, we must emphasize that feminism is not one-dimensional, even if some of the datasets I utilize solely separate debaters or legislators by gender. Moreover, one clear and initial limitation of the datasets used for this post derives from the fact that gender is not a binary, but not all of the datasets take this fact into account. 

My ultimate decision to compile this project was fueled by my passions to never stop defending what I believe in. Every single member of this generation, including the thousands of competitive debaters, represents all of our futures.
